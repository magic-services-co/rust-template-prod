
THIS IS ALL FALSE INFORMATION NOW!!




# The Setup Guide
### Prerequisites
- A domain this site will be hosted on. (we reccomend buying them directly from [cloudflare](https://domains.cloudflare.com/))
- An up to date MySQL database (you may be able to get one from your hosting provider).
- Hosting for discord bot (bun.sh).
- Hosting for website, setup guide shows the proccess of using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

### Understandings
- If an instruction in this list reccomends you to go to `/src/app/` - this means go to the `src` folder, and the `app` folder within, for example -> [see image](https://cdn.mrddd.xyz/img/2025/explorer_RVpdLJs08t)
- If the instruction ends with a file extension, for example `/prisma/seed.js` -> `.js` - this means go to the `prisma` folder, and the `seed.js` **file** within, for example -> [see image](https://cdn.mrddd.xyz/img/2025/explorer_UR377V8Pc5)

## 1. Managing the Files Locally
- You can ignore this step if you know what you're doing.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is highly reccomend for managing the file, and is free.
- We reccomend use [Git Hub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) to upload and manage the files on git hub.

## 2. Changing the Images
### Manual Option
#### The logo and Background Images
- Navigate to `/public/images` and you will see `logo.png` and `background.jpg`, delete them. For example -> [see image](https://cdn.mrddd.xyz/img/2025/explorer_8AvI73eJr6)
- Transfer your logo over while making sure to keep the name `logo.png`. (We reccomend a version of your logo with no background.)
- Transfer your banner over while making sure to keep the name `background.jpg`. (We reccomend using a 1920 x 1080 resolution.)

#### The Favicon (the [icon](https://cdn.mrddd.xyz/img/2025/brave_eDvQHWHecK) you see on the top of your browser)
- Navigate to `/src/app/` and you will see favicon.ico, delete it.
- Visit [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) and make a favicon if, you do not have one already. Inside this website you can upload the same logo file you used.
- Extract the .zip and **only** transfer over the favicon.ico (may show as just "favicon") file by itself into `src/app/`.
- **Done with the images.**

### Theme Editor
- You can do this all via the theme editor, once you have setup the rest of the site. It is explained in the on site configuration docs.

## 3. Getting admin privileges (ADMIN)
- Navigate to `/prisma/seed.js` place your steam64id under `STEP ADMIN.1.` (you will need to scroll down.) -> [see image](https://cdn.mrddd.xyz/img/2025/notepad%2B%2B_0iG5eDokJ0)
- You can get your steam64id -> [here](http://steamid.io/) -> [see image](https://cdn.mrddd.xyz/img/2025/brave_4h2IkLr8wA).
- The details here (except ownerid) can be configured on the websites admin panel at any time, and will be shown later in the setup proccess.
- **Done with admin priviledges.**

## 4. Environment Variables
- Find the `.env.example` file, and rename it to just `.env`. It should look like -> [this](https://cdn.mrddd.xyz/img/2025/explorer_pyLjtWnhsk)
- Open it and put it to the side, you will need it for the rest of these steps.
